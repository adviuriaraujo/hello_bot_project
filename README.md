# Vegpet

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.8.

## About

The purpose of this project is to exercise the skills I learned in the HelloBot course, offered by Let's Bot.
In that course, I learned a chatbot development framework, NLU and went over the basics in Watson Assistant.
As a case study, we were introduced to VegPet, a company that sells vegan pet food. Based on a FAQ spreadsheet, we were asked create intents and responses and then launch our chatbot for user testing.

As I just finished finished my first lessons on Angular, I thought I could try and integrate the Watson webchat on a landing page for VegPet.

For now, the landing page is mainly static (most links and button aren't working yet)

## Planned features

Some sort of back-end to request product information from;
Another page to display products;
Routes;
A login service;
MySQL integration for store user data;

## Disclaimer

This project has no commercial purpose. It is intended as a student project only.
